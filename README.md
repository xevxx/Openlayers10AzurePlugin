# Openlayers10AzurePlugin
Attempt at getting Azure maps layers working with OL10

Not much effort here

took code from https://github.com/azure-samples/azure-maps-openlayers/tree/main/

and fought with an LLM for a few hours to get it to work (only as an incuded file(JS) as thats what i needed

Alos only tested with subscription-key method not full auth.

Works fine with raster map tiles, havent tested, anything else
